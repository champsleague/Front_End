        Sittin' all alone Mouth full of gum In the driveway My friends aren't far
        In the back of my car Lay their bodies Where's my mind Where's my mind
        They'll be here pretty soon Lookin' through my room for the money I'm bitin' my nails I'm too young to go to jail It's kinda funny Where's my mind 
        Where's my mind Where's my mind Where's my mind Maybe it's in the gutter where I left my lover What an expensive fate My V is for Vendetta Thought that I'd feel better
